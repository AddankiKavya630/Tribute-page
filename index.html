            ☛  A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15,
            1931,<span> Rameswaram</span>, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) Indian scientist and
            politician who played a leading role in the development of <span>India's </span> missile and
            <span> nuclear weapons </span> programs.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ He was <span>president</span> of India from 2002 to 2007</li>
       <br>
        <li>☛ Kalam earned a degree in <span> aeronautical engineering </span>from the Madras Institute of Technology
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ In 1969 he moved to the <span>Indian Space Research Organisation,</span> where he was project director of
            the <span>SLV-III,</span> the first satellite <span>SLV-III,</span>xthat was both designed and produced in
            India</li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
            helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate-range
            <span>ballistic missile</span> , which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989. </li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
            scientific adviser (1999-2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. </li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ His prominent role in the <span>country's </span> 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a <span>
                nuclear power</span> and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern
            in the international <span> community</span></li>
            <br>
        <li>☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map
            for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years.
            The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing
            <span>technology </span> as a vehicle for <span>economic growth</span> , and widening access to health care
            and education.
        </li>

        <li>☛
            In 2002 India's ruling <span>National Democratic Alliance</span> (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing
            President Kocheril <span>> Raman Narayanan</span>. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva)
            NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition
            party, <span> the Indian National Congress</span>, also proposed his candidacy.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ He was sworn in as India's 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002.</li>

            country's first woman president.</li>
       <br>
        <li>☛ Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India
            into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities.</li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and
            was pronounced dead fromcspan
            <span> cardiac arrest</span> soon afterward.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>☛ Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were
            two of the country's highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).</li>
